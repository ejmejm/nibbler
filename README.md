# Implementation of The Nibbler Architecture


### TODO
- [ ] Implement base actor-critic learning algorithm with a linear value function on a single catch environment.
- [ ] Extend the implementation to the multi-catch environment.
- [ ] Learn a fixed set of GVFs in parallel, and use them as inputs to the action-value function.
- [ ] Learn a changing set of GVFs in parallel, and use them as inputs to the action-value function.
